
 01/05: V0.80: first pre-release
 01/05: V0.81: prototypes with qualifier __declspec(dllimport) will use
               IAT now (call dword ptr [_imp__xxx]).
 01/05: V0.82: some bugfixes
 01/05: V0.83: more bugfixes
 01/05: V0.84: fixed a memory allocation error
 01/05: V0.85: bit fields without names supported
 01/05: V0.86: size-safe bitfields with -r option
 01/05: V0.87: h2incXd was linked wrong. bitfields created wrong
 01/05: V0.88: [alignment] section added to h2incX.ini
 01/05: V0.89: adding structures to section [structure names] now only
               required for externally defined structures.
 01/05: V0.90: [Known Macros] in h2incX.ini changed to string pairs!
               Added new cmdline switch -i (old -i renamed to -y!) for
               nested processing of header files.
 01/05: V0.91: -I option added.
               -S option added.
               h2incX remembers macros defined in the source, so only
               external macros have to be added to [Known Macros] section
 01/05: V0.92: "enum {}" (without typedef) now converted (VARENUM in wtypes.h)
 01/05: V0.93: "COM" includes can be translated now, at least the C syntax
               part. bugfix: macro invokations in EQU lines sometimes lost
               their braces. A simple GUI sample (sample2) added. -e option
               added.
 01/05: V0.94: MIDL generated macros for virtual function access in C
               (COBJMACROS) are now converted to MASM macros.
               COM server sample (simplestserver) added.
               Function pointers as parameters in (virtual) function pointer
               declarations now handled correctly (method IViewObject::Draw
               in oleidl.h). DirectDraw sample added.
 01/05: V0.95: bugfix: '/' in source may have been interpreted as begin of
               a comment. Method names in STDMETHOD macro checked for reserved
               words. C++ reserved words 'public', 'private', 'operator' and
               'friend' now tolerated.
 01/05: V0.96: bugfix: expressions in enums may have been interpreted as
               function pointers. bugfix: floating point constants now 
               recognized. D3D includes added.
 01/05: V0.97: no more invalid typedefs when translating "forward"
               declarations of MIDL generated includes. Binary searches
               are used now, so h2incX will run faster for large header files.
 01/05: V0.98: bugfix: externdefs were created wrong in version 0.97!
               bugfix: missing includes for simplestserver sample added.
               translated OLECTL.INC and OCIDL.INC added to Include subdir.
 01/05: V0.99: bugfix: VARIANT in OAIDL.INC defined wrong.
 01/05: V0.99.1: (U)LARGE_INTEGER definitions in winnt.h now handled correctly
               bugfix: preprocessor commands now recognized when there are 
               spaces between '#' and the command.
 01/05: V0.99.2: bugfix: enums without name ("enum {...};") caused an access
               violation. bugfix: h2incX didn't recognize end of a comment if
               comment had pattern "/* ... /* ... */". COMMCTRL.INC, 
               WININET.INC and RICHEDIT.INC added to Include subdir.
 02/05: V0.99.3: Handling of string literals improved.
               bugfix: STDMETHOD parameters on succeeding lines were skipped.
               Win32 includes and samples now supplied in an own package at
               http://www.japheth.de/Download/win32inc.zip.
 02/05: V0.99.4: bugfix: some structure names added to [Alignment] section in
               h2incX.ini. Cmdline option -p added.
               bugfix: __declspec(...) now analyzed correctly
 02/05: V0.99.5: Cmdline option -t added.
               bugfix: function pointers as function parameters in prototypes
               now recog
 02/05: V0.99.6: now less equates defined as text literals (<>). Nameless
               structure members in structures recognized. Structures without
               names ["typedef struct {...} * pStructPtr"] now handled 
               correctly.
 02/05: V0.99.7: keyword "class" now accepted. Some very preliminary C++ name
               decorating code added (VC).
 02/05: V0.99.8: cmdline switch -Wn added (so switch -e could be deleted).
               bugfix: empty continuation lines weren't recognized.
               bugfix: pointer types were added to structure symbol table
 02/05: V0.99.9: Warning displayed (-W1) if macro/equate is a reserved word.
               Warning displayed (-W2) if macro parameter is a reserved word.
               Rudimentary support for virtual base classes and virtual 
               function tables. Keyword 'static' recognized.
 02/05: V0.99.10: bugfix: NOT is invalid in if/elseif expressions, replaced
               by "0 eq". cmdline switch -d extended, makes switch -g 
               superfluous. Optionally declaring prototypes with @DefProto
               macro added. "#pragma message()" now converted to %echo, and
               "#error" converted to .err.
 02/05: V0.99.11: bugfix: declaration "struct tagname membername;" in
               structures was converted wrong (winsock.h, sin_addr).
 02/05: V0.99.12: bugfix: bugfix of V0.99.11 wasn't satisfactory, in fact
               introduced another, severe bug.
 02/05: V0.99.13: interface vtable entries of MIDL created header files now
               described with STDMETHOD macro, thus reducing size and
               increasing readability of INC file. 
 02/05: V0.99.14: bugfix: COBJMACROS for interface names beginning with "_" 
               didn't work (ADOINT.H)
 09/05: V0.99.15: some bugfixes
 09/05: V0.99.16: version 0.99.15 wrote the output file in the directory of
               the input files if option -o was omitted.
 01/06: V0.99.17: cmdline switches used when h2incX was launched now copied
               to the include file header.
 07/06: V0.99.18: -e cmdline option added.
 04/07: V0.99.19: copyright message adjusted so it is more clear that
               the copyright is not intended for the created include file.
               message "no items for .DEF file" now is only displayed if
               warning level is > 2.
 03/09: V0.99.20: DOS version now created using HX's DOS-PE feature, it's
               a stand-alone binary. Syntax
                 typedef <simple_type> <new_type>[elements];
               now converted to a structure instead of a typedef.
 08/22: V0.99.21: WinInc dependency removed, now just needs HX.
